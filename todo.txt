Get button to shrink to 75% of it's size instead of hardcoded value

You can appear to have enough clicks but actually be short due to rounding...

Bug where if you click the button too fast after locking your phone on the app and then reopening, you lose your clicks from time passing

Level Ideas:
    Play/theatre
    Movie Production
    Digging holes
    Wizard
    Soccer
    Unicorns

Upgrades:
    click power
    starting clicks
    more levels at once
    clickers cheaper
    clickers increase at slower rate
    bonus cheaper
    bonus increase at slower rate
    overall boost (starting bonus?)
    reward multiplier

Is clicker gonna be backwards compatabile with original clicker?

The win popup needs to be stuck there for a second at least and not be clearable by clicking somewhere else
